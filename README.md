# Aidan Kingsbury Data Science Portfolio
## Introduction
* My name is Aidan Kingsbury and I am studying Applied Mathematics and Environmental Science at
 Wheaton College IL. Within my study of Applied Math, I have had the privelage
 to do some work in data science. Here is a brief overview of some of the 
 work that I have done. My goal here is to showcase the breath of the data I have
 worked with, ranging from geospatial to tabular to Voice to natural language. I have included
 links to websites with my projects, along with some visuals, and a link to the 
 physical jupyter notebook that I did the project in. Feel free to contacct me with
 questions

## [Project 1: Geospatial Data](https://Akingz123.github.io/Portfolio/Project_02.html)
* Using various Geospatial Analysis techniques to study and analyze the movement habits of
 Galapagos Tortoises, specifically looking at migration patterns.

## [Project 2: Natural Language Processing](https://Akingz123.github.io/Portfolio/Project_03.html)
* Training classifiers to sort documents into which United Nations Sustainable Development Goal
they belong to. Running many different combinations of classifier type, vectorizer type, minimum documents
a word or phrase must appear in to be relevant, and the range of sizes of signifigant phrases. Then determining
which configuration of the aforementioned variables produces the most accurate classifier.

## [Project 3: Voice Data](https://Akingz123.github.io/Portfolio/HW_09.html)
* Extracting multiple different features from voices such as f0, zcr, mfcc values, and delta values. Then
 creating classifiers to see how accurately these features can predict a speaker's gender.
