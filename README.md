# Aidan Kingsbury Data Science Portfolio
## [Project 1: Geospatial Data](https://Akingz123.github.io/Portfolio/Project_02.html)
* Using various Geospatial Analysis techniques to study and analyze the movement habits of
* Galapagos Tortoises, specifically looking at migration patterns.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Akingz123/Portfolio/blob/main/Project_02.ipynb)

## [Project 2: Natural Language Processing](https://Akingz123.github.io/Portfolio/Project_03.html)
* Training classifiers to sort documents into which United Nations Sustainable Development Goal
* they belong to. Running many different combinations of classifier type, vectorizer type, minimum documents
* a word or phrase must appear in to be relevant, and the range of sizes of signifigant phrases. Then determining
* which configuration of the aforementioned variables produces the most accurate classifier.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Akingz123/Portfolio/blob/main/Project_03.ipynb)

## [Project 3: Voice Data](https://Akingz123.github.io/Portfolio/HW_09.html)
* Extracting multiple different features from voices such as f0, zcr, mfcc values, and delta values. Then
* creating classifiers to see how accurately these features can predict a speaker's gender.
